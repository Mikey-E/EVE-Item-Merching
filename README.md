This project exists to prioritize which items to make market offers for,
given that there are a limited amount of offers that can be made.

This uses the https://evetycoon.com/api to gather market data for items. Reference: https://evetycoon.com/docs

There exists a file to find valid item ids for the market. It's necessary to run this to
cut down on the amount of API requests that will need to be made. So run it first.
